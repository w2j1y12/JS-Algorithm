#### Objectives

- Describe what a searching algorithm is
- Implement linear search on arrays
- Implement binary search on sorted arrays
- Implement a naive string searching algorithm
- Implement the KMP string searching alogoritm


- There are many different search methods on arrays in JavaScript
  - indexOf
  - includes
  - find
  - findIndex


#### Linear Search
Given an array, the simplest way to search for an value is to look at every element in the array and check if it's the value we want.

#### Binary Search
- Binary search is a much faster form of search
- Rather than eliminating on elemnet at a time, you can eliminate half of the remaining elements at a time
- Binary search only works on sorted arrays!
