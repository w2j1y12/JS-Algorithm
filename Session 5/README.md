# 문제 해결 패턴

#### SOME PATTERNS
1. Frequency Counter
- This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
- This can often avoid need for nested loops or O(N) operations with arrays/string
  - 여러 값과 데이터가 서로 유사한 값으로 구성되어 있는가
  - 서로 간의 애너그램인가
  - 값이 다른 값에 포함되는지의 여부 비교
  - 데이터를 입력값이나 두 개 이상의 빈도 혹은 특정하게 발생하는 빈도와 비교

2. Multiple Pointers 
- Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition
- Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well

3. Sliding Window
- the pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another
- Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or close (and a new window is created)
- Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.

4. Divide and Conquer
- This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data
- This pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity


7. Dynamic Programming
8. Greedy Algorithms
9.Backtracking
